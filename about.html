                I am currently studying Full Stack Web Development at Lambda
                School. When I am not studying or coding websites, I enjoy
                reading, writing, drawing, crocheting, movies, and music. I also
                thoroughly enjoy the adventure of homeschooling my 11 yr old
                son.

                I enjoy complex systems even when I can barely understand them.
                As a child I played Zelda Majora's Mask in a hot room in Florida
                till it powered off due to overheating. I'm here to fill my
                dog's food bowl and hopefully fulfill some dreams.
