          As a teacher, it can be hard to control the noise level in your
          classroom! You need an app that holds kids attention, and is sensitive
          to the noise level in the room to motivate them to stay quiet. While
          some exist, they seem to encourage kids to yell (like balls that
          bounce higher if you yell louder). This app will reveal unique animals
          (choose a theme for this app) only if it's quiet enough, keeping the
          kids quiet.
